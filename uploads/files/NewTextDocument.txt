<h4 class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 7.5pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 7.5pt; margin-left: 0in;">Casco Bay TMS &ndash; Providing Treatment and Relief to Patients with Depression</h4>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;">Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation, or TMS, is one of the most technologically-advanced<strong> </strong><a href="depression-tms/treating-depression-tms.php"><span style="color: blue;">depression treatments</span></a><span style="color: #333333;">&nbsp;</span>available. It is a simple drug-free way to treat depression, anxiety and many other neurologically-based illnesses and is available at Casco Bay TMS in Portland, Maine.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><a name="h.gjdgxs"></a>When medications don't provide relief or you cannot tolerate the side effects of medications, then TMS therapy may be the right treatment for you. TMS, or&nbsp;<a href="transcranialmagneticstimulation/index.php"><span style="color: blue;">Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Therapy</span></a><span style="color: #333333;">,&nbsp;</span>is a non-invasive, FDA-cleared (for depression only at this time) brain-based outpatient treatment that has helped thousands of patients throughout the world. People are getting relief. When the brain is functioning properly people make better decisions; their relationships improve; they return to work; their lives are transformed.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">At Casco Bay TMS our results are excellent. &nbsp;Nearly 50% of our patients who undergo TMS therapy for depression go into&nbsp;remission,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>meaning they are no longer depressed. Of all the remaining patients, while not symptom free, 75% achieve what is called, "response." &nbsp;They report feeling significantly better after completing treatment. We attribute our high success rate to our skilled staff, and the fact that we also treat anxiety as part of a person's depression (if clinically indicated).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">To the right of your screen take a look at the picture (PET scan) of two brains. &nbsp;The brain on the left is a picture of a healthy brain. &nbsp;It has a lot of metabolic activity (the areas that are lit up) and the activity is balanced. &nbsp;You will see the image on the right is a picture of a brain with depression. &nbsp;The difference is striking. &nbsp;The depressed brain has low metabolic activity and is not balanced. &nbsp;TMS works to bring your brain into balance -- like the brain on the left. &nbsp;A balanced and healthy brain.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">We are also successfully treating a variety of other brain-based illnesses such as migraines, seizures and others. &nbsp;Please see the section entitled, "Off Label," above on the menu bar for a list of other conditions. &nbsp;Note that these, "off-label" conditions are not FDA cleared, nor are they covered by insurance. &nbsp;However, many brain-based conditions are being treated with TMS all around the world in various hospitals, research facilities and provider offices. &nbsp;We have a unique way of analyzing these conditions using an EEG. &nbsp;We analyze that data and are able to create a "Brain Map." Your specific brain can be analyzed and treatment tailored to specific imbalances within your specific brain.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">TMS therapy has been used in hospitals since the 1980s and with&nbsp;<a href="neurostarTMSTherapy/index.php"><span style="color: blue;">Neurostar&reg; TMS Therapy</span></a><span style="color: #333333;">, </span>the treatment is now available right here in Portland, Maine. &nbsp;We invite you to contact us to learn more about this powerful treatment for depression and other brain imbalances.&nbsp;<span style="color: #333333;"> </span><a href="uploads/documents/PHQ-9.pdf"><span style="color: blue;">Take this questionnaire</span></a><span style="color: #333333;">&nbsp;about depression&nbsp;</span>and bring it with you for a consultation. This will help us better understand your depression and determine if you are a good fit for TMS. Call or email today to schedule a consultation and take that next step to health.</p>
